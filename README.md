# MilkVRLinks
Generates mrvl files for video files hosted on a server.

This assumes you have a proper MilkVR videotype suffix for the file, eg `video_180x180_3dh.mp4`. 

The suffix will be stripped the title and resulting link filename.

Usage
=====

In the directory containing your video files, copy the exe (and optionally the config).

```
milkvrlinks [baseurl [searchpattern]]
```
Or edit the config file to your liking (so you can just double click).

Just copy the generated files to your MilkVR directory on your phone.

Requires .NET
